# ADA: GBQ and SQLite

This repo supports some in-class work with Google BigQuery and SQLite. Here are the steps to follow: 

1. Clone this repo.
2. Download the data for the exercise [here](https://www.dropbox.com/t/FyPp5lh8tbGL4Pmo) and unzip it into the repo. (The `.gitignore` file is set up to prevent `transction_data.txt` or its zip from going in the repo.)
3. Head over to the notebook "Build DBs.ipynb" and follow along. 
4. Throughout the document I've asked you perform some tasks, write some queries, and answer some questions.
